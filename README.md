# What is Bionic Reading?

( Taken from https://bionic-reading.com/ )

Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word. In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.

# Installation

The extension is not yet submitted to Chrome Store. You can install it manually by following the instructions [here](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).

# Usage

Once the extension is installed, you can enable it by pressing `Alt + B` (configurable — see below) on any page.

# Configuration

For now, you can configure the extension by manually modifying the `settings.js` file. In the future, I will provide a configuration popup.

# Notes

I couldn’t find a way to use the original Bionic Reading API (the page just doesn’t load for me). So currently I’m using the dumbest way possible: I’m taking the first part of the word and making it bolder. Once I figure out how to use the API, I’ll update the extension.
